## HMM_Kunitz_domain

This repository contains the material related to the construction of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for the Kunitz domain.

### Folder Contents:

- **HMM_multiple_sequence_align**: Contains all the scripts, codes, input files, and output files used to build the model based on Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA).

- **HMM_multiple_structure_align**: Contains all the scripts, codes, input files, and output files used to build the model based on MSA derived from Multiple Structure Alignment.

### Structure of Subfolders:

- **Scripts**: This folder contains all Python scripts and codes used for the implementation of the project.

- **sequences_files**: Contains all information related to the collection of the dataset and the benchmark set, along with all intermediate files processed during the analysis and execution of the project.

- **output_results**: Contains the files related to the outputs generated during the execution of the HMM models for the Kunitz domain, including the plot and data of the performance analysis.
